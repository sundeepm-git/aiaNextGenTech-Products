# Agents

This directory contains AgenticAI implementations - autonomous agents that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with various tools and APIs.

## What are Agents?

Agents are autonomous AI systems that can:
- Understand and break down complex tasks
- Use tools and APIs to accomplish goals
- Make decisions based on context and feedback
- Maintain conversation history and context
- Work collaboratively in multi-agent systems
